# Professional README Generator

## Description

This app allows web developers to take control over their professional README's. With a few prompts from the command line, the user will answer the questions in the order they are answered and a professional looking README complete with table of contents, license badges, link to github and email, etc. will be created. This app alleviates the need for researching which elements belong inside a README and takes the grunt work out of setting up the README. I learned a great deal from this including but not limited to using Inquirer, using module exports, using a file system to append data to a README.md file, and much more! The professional README generator is a fantastic tool that all web devs would benefit from using.

## Installation

For installation, we used npm init -y to install our package.json files, npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install a certain version of inquirer, require fs for our file system, and require generateMarkdown which was our own created JS file.

## Usage

To use, the user must open the terminal or command line, navigate to the correct folder and run "node index". From there, the program will run and the user will be allowed to answer the prompts.
